# COVID19-Denisty-Mapping-Using-GeoPandas
An interactive map with a date slider for seeing the progression of confirmed COVID19 cases around the world using a combination of pandas, geopandas, folium, and other python libraries.

**Very Important:** The uploaded ipythn file imports external python libraries which make the interactive map fail to load.
