# COVID19-Denisty-Mapping-Using-GeoPandas
An interactive map with a date slider for seeing the progression of confirmed COVID19 cases around the world using a combination of pandas, geopandas, folium, and other python libraries.

**Very Important:** The uploaded ipythn file imports external python libraries which make the interactive map fail to load. To see the source code, the uploaded file is enough, but to see the maps in action, use this nbviwer link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gsechkin/COVID19-Denisty-Mapping-Using-GeoPandas/blob/main/COVID19%20Density%20Mapping%20with%20GeoPandas.ipynb
